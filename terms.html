    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last updated: December 31, 2025</p>

    <p>
      Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms") carefully before using the Add to Calendar Chrome extension 
      ("Service") operated by Add to Calendar ("us", "we", or "our").
    </p>

    <h2>Acceptance of Terms</h2>
    <p>
      By installing and using our extension, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any 
      part of the terms, you may not use the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Description of Service</h2>
    <p>
      Add to Calendar is a Chrome browser extension that allows users to create Google Calendar events from 
      selected text on web pages. The extension uses artificial intelligence to extract event details such 
      as dates, times, locations, and descriptions from the selected text.
    </p>

    <h2>User Accounts and Authentication</h2>
    <p>
      To use the Service, you must authenticate with your Google account. By doing so, you grant us permission 
      to create and manage calendar events on your behalf. You are responsible for maintaining the security of 
      your Google account.
    </p>

    <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Use the Service for any illegal purpose or in violation of any laws</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the extension</li>
      <li>Use the Service to transmit malicious code or interfere with other users</li>
      <li>Use automated systems or software to extract data from the Service</li>
      <li>Misrepresent your identity or affiliation with any person or entity</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are owned by Add to Calendar and are 
      protected by international copyright, trademark, and other intellectual property laws.
    </p>

    <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      The Service is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind, either express or 
      implied. We do not guarantee that the Service will be uninterrupted, secure, or error-free. The AI-powered 
      text extraction may not always be accurate, and you should verify event details before saving.
    </p>

    <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      In no event shall Add to Calendar, its directors, employees, partners, or affiliates be liable for any 
      indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of 
      profits, data, or other intangible losses, resulting from your use of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      Our Service integrates with Google Calendar and uses third-party AI services. Your use of these 
      third-party services is subject to their respective terms of service and privacy policies.
    </p>

    <h2>Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice, for any reason, 
      including if you breach these Terms. You may stop using the Service at any time by uninstalling the extension.
    </p>

    <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time. We will notify users of any material changes by 
      updating the "Last updated" date. Your continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance 
      of the new Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with applicable laws, without regard to 
      conflict of law provisions.
